                <p>Draft 1:</p>
                <p>the earth holds its breath in these moments / before the thaw comes in earnest / frost still crisp beneath my boots / and the dog's eager panting clouds the air / we are the only living things stirring / except for the brave crocuses pushing through half-frozen soil / their purple heads bent like monks in prayer / my fingers ache inside wool gloves / but something in me knows the warmth is coming / like the way birds know to return / my body remembers other springs / other mornings / the quiet street belongs to us alone / each footfall echoing off empty porches / dawn barely scratching at the horizon / and my dog stops to investigate something I cannot smell / his whole being alert and present / while my mind drifts between seasons / between sleeping and waking / between the person I am in darkness and the one I become in light / the mail truck will come later / children will wait for buses / but for now the world is all potential / all breath / all beating heart and muscle and bone / moving through space like prayer</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card"></div>
                <p>Draft 2:</p>
                <p> dawn comes later than you'd think / when you're the only one awake / frost whitens the grass like confectioner's sugar / and the dog's nails click against sidewalk ice / we are learning the world by touch / by scent / by the way morning air stings our lungs / winter is letting go its grip slowly / reluctantly / like a lover who knows the affair is ending / but still the earth turns toward warmth / still the bulbs remember their purpose / buried in cold soil / my feet know the route without thinking / while my mind floats untethered / between what was and what will be / the dog stops suddenly / alert to movement I cannot see / his body a question mark against the grey light / we are making a map of morning / with footsteps and breath / with the space between heartbeats / with the silence that lives between winter and spring / soon the world will wake / but for now we are alone with our solitude / alone with the promise of green things growing</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">    
                <p>Draft 3:</p>
                <p>each morning begins the same / leash in hand / boots unlaced / stumbling into pre-dawn darkness / but this morning feels different / there's a softness to the air / despite the lingering cold / as if the earth is holding its breath / waiting / my dog pulls ahead / his black coat collecting frost / while I follow half-awake / my body moving through space like muscle memory / like prayer / like the slow turn of seasons / somewhere beneath our feet / bulbs are stirring / sending up blind shoots / toward a warmth they remember / my fingers ache in wool gloves / but there's a promise in the pain / like the way birds know their migrations / without being told / we walk the empty streets / making maps of morning / with footprints and breath / with the space between heartbeats / with all the quiet moments that live / between sleeping and waking / between winter and spring / between what we are / and what we are becoming / soon the world will wake / but for now / we are alone with our solitude / alone with the knowledge / that everything changes / everything returns / everything grows</p>

                <p>cold dog walks at dawn â€”</p>
                <p>frost melts on crocuses while</p>
