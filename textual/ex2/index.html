                <p>The air bites with the last sharp teeth of winter / his breath clouds / ghosting ahead like an impatient companion / the leash taut between hand and paw / the dog sniffs at frost-tipped grass / a curious archaeologist of smells left by the night / nothing stirs / not yet / the world is suspended / between the dark hours and the first light / clouds bruise the horizon / faint purple / a suggestion of day’s arrival / the man’s hands stiffen / fingers curled tight against the cold / but his body moves anyway / familiar steps / the crunch of shoes on frozen soil / a rhythm born of countless mornings like this / and yet / something feels lighter today / the earth softer / the wind slower / as though the world itself is loosening / unfurling / promising / the dog pauses / ears perked / nose pointed toward the edge of the field where dew glints like new stars / and the man breathes / deep / the air still cold in his chest / but alive / alive in a way that speaks of change / of greenness hiding beneath the frost / of silence waiting to break into birdcalls and bees / his muscles warm as he bends / scratches the dog’s ears / a fleeting moment of shared warmth / shared knowing / the leash slackens / and they walk on / together / into the pale and waking spring.</p>
